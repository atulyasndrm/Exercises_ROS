# Please Forgive Me

I have just included the workspace because I am working on the other parts and changing the folder will imply that I have to change the source devels.


I will still work on the documentation, if you allow me, cause that was a lot of fun to do. Then you can remove me.

I didnt learn ROS properly when it was initially taught and didn't do the initial assignments and thus never got my doubts cleared. So I relearnt ROS through the ETH.

I will keep learning it after you remove me. Just like let me be in the server and like learn the stuff. I just want to learn. 

Sorry for everything.

I will pay for the ODROID after I get a job. I promise I will do that, how much ever it was.
